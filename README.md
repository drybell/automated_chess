# AUTOMATED CHESS SET 

Class Project for ME93: Building a self-controlled chess board using magnets and a three way Stepper Motor system

Code Update: Implemented the chess game board, working on piece movements for a text based
chess game. 

Next Steps: Working to move on to a GUI chess set, then incorporating a TD(lambda) learning
algorithm to train a machine to play chess

Final Goal: Have a Raspberry Pi hosting a web server which will output a chess GUI where
a player can choose to play against the computer or another player. When the player
inputs movement, 2 Arduino will control the logic for 3 stepper motors to locate, move, and
update the game board respective to the game board displayed to the player.
